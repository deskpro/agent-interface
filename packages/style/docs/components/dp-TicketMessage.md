			<p>Good day Brian,</p>
			 
			<p>We’ve been having another issue with this version of DeskPro. I’ve been doing some troubleshooting with our SSO partner but no luck so far so I thought it wouldn’t hurt to bounce it off of you. The thing is, we configured both Agent and User modules to use SSO and it was working great for a few days. When I came into the office last week Friday I realized that I wasn’t able to log into the Admin/Agent portals but I was able to log in to the User portal. Upon further investigation, we realized that we weren’t able to log in if the SSO URLs were the same.</p>
			 
			<p>We tried clearing browser data in Chrome and trying incognito but no luck. Have you ever seen anything like this before?</p>
			 
			<p>Let me know if anything pops up in your head.</p>
			 
			Thanks,<br>
			Zack
